\
why can\'92t hallways be squished to 1 tile wide when sliding a room toward the hallway?\
\
sometimes rooms still generate overlapping onto other rooms by 1 tile\

Next Steps
\b0 \ulnone \
\
add doorHandler\
	dungeonLevel number determines the max door num\
	new doors are created minimum 1 per room, but 2 per room ever 3 rooms or so, 4  per room every 6 - 10 rooms?\
	once that number of doors has been generated, no more doors can be added to rooms\
	when a new room is being created, it asks doorHandler for the next unconnected door, and it build the room from there\
\
Non-hallway rooms should be able to generate attached non-hallway rooms occasionally (one in five?). This would be easy to make happen, but it would have broken consequences, as a lot of logic assumes we are always alternating between hallways and non-hallways\
\
add stairs - entrances and exits (< and >)\
	randomly choose top or left or bottom or right, then the room to that level edge gets the starting stairs\
	then choose ending stairs from remaining 3 sides\
\
Add player\
	WASD navigates\
\
output to file\
	codification/serialization from dungeon to strings in text file\
		levelnum\
		levelRooms - list\
			roomnum\
			room loc\
			objects -list\
				connection (room num)\
				type\
	game state\
		\'85\
		...\
\
take in from file(s) on game load - create game objects from text file serialization\
	CSDungeonLevel\
	CSRoom list\
		etc\
